We need cookies (unique ids) for each user
for this we'll use npm uuid
Go to Inspect>Application>Cookies to see the cookies when you're logged in

We implemeted basic authentication and used stateful session management.
The stateful session management has resulted in cookie disappearance upon restarting the server 

The stateless session management will solve this problem as the id assigned to user can be viewed but
can never be changed

(think of the example of the valet boy assigning a ticket to your car)
To implement this, we'll be using Json Web Tokens (JWTs)

Now we have a unique token for each user which will expire after a significantly longer date than the session timeout
